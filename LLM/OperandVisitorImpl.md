if i will use to calculate number of operands in code snippet which functions should I implement

If you want to **use `VoidVisitorAdapter` to calculate the number of operands in a Java code snippet**, you need to:

1. Understand **what counts as an operand** in Java source code.
   Typically, operands are:

    * Literals (e.g., numbers, strings)
    * Variables (identifiers)
    * Field accesses
    * Method calls arguments
    * Maybe more depending on your definition

2. **Override the visitor methods** corresponding to AST nodes that represent operands.

---

### Which visitor methods to override?

Here are the main AST node types that correspond to operands you should consider:

* **NameExpr**: Represents a variable or identifier usage.
  Override `visit(NameExpr n, Void arg)`

* **LiteralExpr** subclasses (these represent literals like numbers, strings, booleans):

    * `IntegerLiteralExpr`
    * `StringLiteralExpr`
    * `BooleanLiteralExpr`
    * `DoubleLiteralExpr`
    * `CharLiteralExpr`
    * etc.
      You can override `visit(LiteralExpr n, Void arg)` or individually for each literal type.

* **FieldAccessExpr**: Accessing a field (e.g., `obj.field`)
  Override `visit(FieldAccessExpr n, Void arg)`

* **MethodCallExpr** arguments: If you want to count operands inside method call arguments, those will be visited anyway by visiting children.

* **ArrayAccessExpr**: Accessing an element in an array is also an operand.
  Override `visit(ArrayAccessExpr n, Void arg)`

* **ThisExpr** and **SuperExpr**: References to `this` and `super` (depending on your operand definition).

---

### Minimal example approach

You can override at least:

```java
@Override
public void visit(NameExpr n, Void arg) {
    count++;
    super.visit(n, arg);
}

@Override
public void visit(LiteralExpr n, Void arg) {
    count++;
    super.visit(n, arg);
}

@Override
public void visit(FieldAccessExpr n, Void arg) {
    count++;
    super.visit(n, arg);
}

@Override
public void visit(ArrayAccessExpr n, Void arg) {
    count++;
    super.visit(n, arg);
}
```

`count` is an integer field you maintain in your visitor to track the number of operands.

---

### Summary

* Override visitor methods for **variable names**, **literals**, **field accesses**, **array accesses**.
* In each, increment your operand count.
* Call `super.visit(n, arg)` to continue traversing children nodes.
