# Java Code Readability Analysis Tool

A Java-based tool for analyzing and classifying the readability of Java code snippets using various software metrics and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive code readability analysis system that can:
- Extract various software metrics from Java code snippets
- Preprocess code data for machine learning analysis
- Classify code readability using trained models
- Support multiple feature metrics for comprehensive analysis

## Features

### Supported Metrics

The tool supports the following readability metrics:

- **LINES**: Number of lines in the code snippet
- **TOKEN_ENTROPY**: Token entropy measure for code complexity
- **H_VOLUME**: Halstead Volume metric for program complexity
- **CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY**: McCabe's cyclomatic complexity measure

### Core Functionality

- **Preprocessing**: Extract features from Java code snippets and generate training datasets
- **Classification**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for readability prediction
- **Flexible Input**: Support for `.jsnp` (Java snippet) files and CSV ground truth data
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with subcommands for different operations

```

## Requirements

- **Java**: JDK 21 or higher
- **Maven**: 3.6+ for building and dependency management
- **Dependencies**: See `pom.xml` for complete list

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Readability-Analysis
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

3. Create executable JAR:
```bash
mvn package
```

## Usage

The tool provides two main subcommands:

### 1. Preprocess Command

Extract features from Java code snippets and generate training datasets.

```bash
java -jar target/Readability-Analysis-1.0.jar preprocess \
    -s <source-directory> \
    -g <ground-truth-file> \
    -t <target-csv-file> \
    [LINES] [TOKEN_ENTROPY] [H_VOLUME] [CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY]
```

**Parameters:**
- `-s, --source`: Directory containing `.jsnp` files
- `-g, --ground-truth`: CSV file with human readability ratings
- `-t, --target`: Output CSV file for training data
- Feature metrics: Choose one or more from the supported metrics

**Example:**
```bash
java -jar target/Readability-Analysis-1.0.jar preprocess \
    -s resources/snippets \
    -g resources/truth_scores.csv \
    -t training_data.csv \
    LINES TOKEN_ENTROPY CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY
```

### 2. Classify Command

Train and evaluate machine learning models for readability classification.

```bash
java -jar target/Readability-Analysis-1.0.jar classify \
    -d <training-data-file>
```

**Parameters:**
- `-d, --data`: CSV file containing preprocessed training data

**Example:**
```bash
java -jar target/Readability-Analysis-1.0.jar classify \
    -d training_data.csv
```

## Input Format

### Java Snippets (.jsnp files)

The tool expects Java code snippets in `.jsnp` files. These should contain valid Java code that can be parsed by JavaParser.

### Ground Truth CSV

The ground truth file should contain human readability ratings in the following format:
- First column: Rater identifier
- Subsequent columns: Snippet1, Snippet2, ..., SnippetN
- Values: Readability scores (typically 1-5 scale)

### Output Format

The preprocessing step generates a CSV file with:
- First column: Snippet filename
- Feature columns: Values for each selected metric
- Target column: Average human readability rating

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Compile
mvn compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Generate test coverage report
mvn jacoco:report

# Run mutation testing
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage

# Package
mvn package
```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all components:
- Unit tests for feature metrics
- Integration tests for utility classes
- Test coverage reporting with JaCoCo
- Mutation testing with PIT

### Code Quality

- **Coverage**: JaCoCo integration for test coverage
- **Mutation Testing**: PIT for mutation testing
- **Static Analysis**: Maven plugins for code quality

## Dependencies

- **JavaParser**: Java code parsing and AST manipulation
- **Weka**: Machine learning library for classification
- **Picocli**: Command-line interface framework
- **Guava**: Google's core Java libraries
- **JUnit 5**: Testing framework
